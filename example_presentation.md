SSH Slides
=============

Welcome to SSH Slides! Create your presentations using markdown. In fact, the source for this README is at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivantsepp/ssh-slides/master/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivantsepp/ssh-slides/master/README.md).

You can use anything that is supported by markdown. To create a new slide, use `---` to separate your pages.

To advance the slides, use your arrow keys. To disconnect, press control D (^D).
